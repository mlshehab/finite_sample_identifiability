# Finite Sample Identifiability

This repository contains the code for the finite sample extension of IRL (Inverse Reinforcement Learning) identifiability.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to extend the concept of identifiability in Inverse Reinforcement Learning to finite sample scenarios. Identifiability refers to the ability to uniquely recover the underlying parameters of a model or system from observed data. In the context of IRL, identifiability is crucial for accurately inferring the reward function of an agent from its observed behavior.
